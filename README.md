After launching the application, the user needs to either log into their account or register a new one. In case the user has already logged into their account from this device, upon the next launch, after pressing the login button, the user will be immediately redirected to the next page without the need to fill in login fields. Next, the user is presented with a choice of four tabs.

The first tab is the "Courses" tab. It contains four pages: "Next Lesson," "Active Course Lessons," "User's Courses," and "All Courses." To view any lesson, the user must visit the "All Courses" page. After clicking on any of the courses on this page, that course will be added to the user's courses, and a page with the lessons of the course will open in front of the user. After clicking on any lesson, the user is taken to a page displaying the content of that lesson, i.e., video and text.

The second tab is the "Tasks" tab. The program includes three types of tasks, as well as mixed tasks that are a combination of all the previous ones. The first type of task involves matching pairs of words; the user needs to choose a Russian word corresponding to its English counterpart and then press the check button. If the user makes three mistakes, a message will be displayed, and the task will be closed. The second type requires completing a sentence by selecting the correct option that logically completes the sentence. The third type involves correctly translating a sentence from Russian to English.

The third tab is the "Dictionary." Here, users can add and delete words and phrases they input. Initially, the user needs to write the first version, after which they must write the second version. To delete a word, the user needs to press the delete button while the word is selected.

The last tab is the "Profile" tab. It displays the user's name, as well as statistics on completed tasks and courses taken.
